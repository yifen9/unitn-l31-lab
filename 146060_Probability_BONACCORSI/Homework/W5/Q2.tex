	\section*{Question 2}
	
	\noindent Consider a binary communication channel, with every digit in the input having a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p = 0.8$ (i.e., the probability of sending $1$ is $p$). A "word" contains 6 digits: $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_6$.
	
	\bigskip
	
	\begin{enumerate}[start=1,label={\bfseries Part \arabic*:},leftmargin=0in]
		\bigskip\item What is the probability that a word contains exactly four $1$'s and two $0$'s?
		
		\subsection*{Solution}
		
			As given, we can define the Bernoulli distribution with sample space $\{0,1\}$ ($0$ denotes $not\enspace received$ and $1$ denotes $received$) and with parameter $p = 0.8$, then we can define its Binomial distribution as
			
			\[X\sim \text{Bin}(n,p),\quad n = 6\]
			
			Then we can know the probability that a word contains exactly four $1$'s and two $0$'s
			
			\[
			\begin{aligned}
				\bP(X = 4) &= \dbinom{n}{4}p^4(1-p)^{n-4}\\
				&= 0.163\,84
			\end{aligned}
			\]
		
		\subsection*{Answer}
		
			\[\boxed{\bP(X = 4) = 0.163\,84}\]
		
		\bigskip\item What is the probability that a word contains at least four $1$'s?
		
		\subsection*{Solution}
		
			\[
			\begin{aligned}
				\bP(X >= 4) &= \sum_{k = 4}^n\bP(X = k)\\
				&= \sum_{i = 4}^n\dbinom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\
				&= 0.819\,2
			\end{aligned}
			\]
		
		\subsection*{Answer}
		
			\[\boxed{\bP(X >= 4) = 0.819\,2}\]
			
		\bigskip\item Assume that the first digit is $X_1 = 1$. What is the probability that the sum of the first two digits is $2$?
		
		\subsection*{Solution}
		
			Let the trials be denoted as
			
			\[X_i,\quad i\in\{1,2,\dots,n\}\]
			
			Then we have
			
			\[
			\begin{aligned}
				\bP_{X_1=1}(X_1 + X_2 = 2) &= \bP(X_2 = 1)\\
				&= p\\
				&= 0.8
			\end{aligned}
			\]
		
		\subsection*{Answer}
		
			\[\boxed{\bP_{X_1=1}(X_1 + X_2 = 2) = 0.8}\]
	\end{enumerate}
