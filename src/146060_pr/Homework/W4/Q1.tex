	\section*{Question 1}
	
	\noindent A student is applying to Harvard and Dartmouth. She estimates that she has a probability of $0.5$ of being accepted at Dartmouth and $0.3$ of being accepted at Harvard. She further estimates that the probability that she will be accepted by both is $0.2$.
	
	\bigskip
	
	\begin{enumerate}[start=1,label={\bfseries Part \arabic*:},leftmargin=0in]
		\bigskip\item What is the probability that she is accepted by Dartmouth if she is accepted by Harvard?
		
		\subsection*{Solution}
		
			Let $\it{accept}$ and $\it{reject}$ denote the results of an application, and let $D$ and $H$ denote the events of being accepted by Dartmouth and by Harvard, respectively. Define the probability space as
		
			\[
			\begin{aligned}
				\Omega &= \{\mathrm{accept},\,\mathrm{reject}\}\\
				\mathcal{F} &= \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\\
				\bP &:\enspace \bP(D) = 0.5,\enspace \bP(H) = 0.3
			\end{aligned}
			\]
			
			We know that
			
			\[\bP(D\cap H) = 0.2\]
			
			Then we have
			
			\[\bP_H(D) = \frac{\bP(D\cap H)}{\bP(H)} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667\]
		
		\subsection*{Answer}
		
			\[\boxed{\bP_H(D) = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667}\]
		
		\bigskip\item Is the event “accepted at Harvard” independent of the event “accepted at Dartmouth”?
		
		\subsection*{Solution}
		
			Applying the Bayes’ Theorem, we know that
			
			\[\bP_D(H) = \frac{\bP_H(D)\bP(H)}{\bP(D)} = 0.4 \ne 0.3 = \bP(H)\]
			
			Then we know that $D$ and $H$ are not stochastically independent.
		
		\subsection*{Answer}
		
			\[\boxed{\text{No, $H$ is not stochastically independent of $D$.}}\]
